# Smart Home System with ESP32 and Arduino

This project implements a **Smart Home System** using the **ESP32** and **Arduino UNO**. The system leverages the **ESP32** for its WiFi capabilities to host a web server, allowing users to control smart home devices and view sensor data through a browser. The **Arduino UNO** handles sensors and actuators, enabling real-time interaction with the home environment.

## Features

- **Web Server**: The ESP32 hosts a web server accessible through any browser.
- **WiFi Integration**: Control your smart home devices over WiFi from a smartphone, tablet, or computer.
- **Real-Time Data**: View sensor data collected by the Arduino via the web server.
- **Modular Design**:
  - Security Module: Manages access control, motion detection, and alarms.
  - Environment Module: Controls lighting and monitors temperature and humidity.
  - Garden Module: Manages soil moisture detection and watering systems.
- **Notifications**: Real-time feedback via buzzer tones and optional smartphone alerts.

## Modular Project Structure

### **1. Security Module**
- **Components**:
  - RFID-based access control.
  - PIR motion sensor for detecting intrusions.
  - Alarm system using buzzer and LED indicators.
  - Door lock controlled by a servo motor.
- **Functions**:
  - Grant/restrict access with RFID.
  - Trigger alarms based on motion detection.
  - Lock and unlock doors remotely.

### **2. Environment Module**
- **Components**:
  - LDR (Light-Dependent Resistor) for ambient light detection.
  - RGB LED or standard LED for lighting control.
  - DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity monitoring.
  - Servo motor for ventilation based on thresholds.
- **Functions**:
  - Automate lighting based on ambient light.
  - Display temperature and humidity data.
  - Activate ventilation when temperature exceeds a threshold.

### **3. Garden Module**
- **Components**:
  - Soil moisture sensor.
  - Water valve controlled by a servo motor.
  - Optional rain sensor for additional input.
- **Functions**:
  - Automatically water plants based on soil moisture levels.
  - Suspend watering during rain (if rain sensor is included).

## Additions for Improved Functionality

### **1. Control Interface**
- Options:
  - Add an LCD with buttons or a keypad for manual overrides.
  - Integrate a Bluetooth module (e.g., HC-05) for smartphone-based control.

### **2. Notifications**
- Real-time feedback:
  - Use buzzer tones to differentiate between alerts (e.g., security breach, low soil moisture, temperature warnings).
  - Optional: Add a Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266) to send smartphone notifications.

### **3. Advanced Features**
- **Energy Efficiency**:
  - Use relays to power off unused systems when not needed (e.g., turn off lights when no motion is detected).
- **Safety**:
  - Add a backup power system (e.g., 9V battery) for critical features like security alarms and door locks.

## Simplifications

### **1. Simplify Lighting Control**
- Use simple LEDs with LDR for lighting instead of an RGB LED to reduce complexity.

### **2. Focus on Core Garden Features**
- Rely solely on the soil moisture sensor for watering decisions.
- Remove the rain sensor unless absolutely necessary.

### **3. Avoid Overloading the Arduino**
- Ensure components are distributed logically across modules to avoid overwhelming the Arduinoâ€™s resources.

## Implementation Plan

### **1. Wiring**
- Use breadboards and jumper wires to organize connections.
- Label components and wires to avoid confusion.

### **2. Code Structure**
- Modularize the code by creating separate functions or classes for each module:
  - `handleSecurity()`
  - `handleEnvironment()`
  - `handleGarden()`
- Use a state machine to manage mode transitions (e.g., "armed" vs. "disarmed" for the security system).

### **3. Testing**
- Test each module independently:
  - Security module: Ensure RFID works with the servo motor and alarm.
  - Environment module: Verify lighting and ventilation controls.
  - Garden module: Confirm soil moisture sensor triggers watering correctly.
- Integrate modules and test interactions:
  - Example: Ensure lighting and ventilation do not interfere with security alarms.

## Getting Started

### **1. Hardware Setup**
- Wire the ESP32 and Arduino according to the chosen protocol (UART or I2C).
- Connect sensors and actuators as required for each module.

### **2. Software Setup**
- Install the Arduino IDE and required board packages for the ESP32 and Arduino UNO.
- Upload the respective codes:
  - **ESP32**: `esp32_code.ino`
  - **Arduino UNO**: `arduino_code.ino`

### **3. Web Server Access**
- Power on the ESP32 and connect it to your WiFi network.
- Note the IP address printed on the Serial Monitor.
- Access the web server by entering the ESP32's IP address in your browser.

### **4. Test Functionality**
- Use the web interface to control connected devices (e.g., turn LEDs on/off).
- View real-time sensor data on the web server.

## Future Improvements

- **Cloud Integration**: Connect the system to a cloud service for remote monitoring and control.
- **Mobile App**: Create a dedicated app for easier control and notifications.
- **Advanced AI Features**: Integrate machine learning for predictive automation (e.g., predict watering schedules).

## Conclusion

This modular, scalable project combines the WiFi capabilities of the ESP32 with the sensor-handling power of the Arduino UNO to create a robust and flexible smart home system. By organizing the project into logical modules and focusing on core features, the system is easier to build, debug, and expand in the future.
