## Implementation Plan

### **1. Hardware Setup**
- Connect the Arduino to sensors and actuators.
- Wire the ESP32 to the Arduino for UART/I2C communication.
- Ensure proper connections for power and data lines.

### **2. Software Setup**
- Install the Arduino IDE and required board packages for ESP32 and Arduino.
- Configure Firebase and obtain project credentials (API key, database URL).
- Upload code:
  - **Arduino**: Handles sensor data collection and actuator control.
  - **ESP32**: Manages WiFi connection and Firebase synchronization.

### **3. Firebase Configuration**
- Create a Realtime Database in Firebase.
- Define database structure (e.g., `/sensors`, `/devices`).
- Set up rules for secure read/write access.

### **4. Web Interface Deployment**
- Host the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files locally or on a web server.
- Use Firebase SDK to connect to the database.
- Test the interface for real-time updates and device control.

### **5. Testing and Debugging**
- Test individual modules (security, environment, garden) independently.
- Verify Arduino-ESP32 communication.
- Confirm real-time updates between Firebase and the web interface.

## How to start the web application using Python

### How to Start a Python Server

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and starting a Python server using the built-in HTTP server module. This method is simple, requires no additional installations, and is suitable for testing or serving files locally.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python Installed**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
  - To check if Python is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type:
    ```bash
    python --version
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
  - If Python is not installed, download and install it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

---

## Starting the Python HTTP Server

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**:
   Navigate to the directory containing the files you want to serve. You can use the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/directory

2. **Start the Server**: Depending on your Python version, run one of the following commands:
- For Python 3:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

- For Python 2:
```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

3. **Access the Server**:
- Open a web browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8000
```
